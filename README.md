**Project Title:** Smart Home Management System  
**Course:** MS in Information Systems - DAMG 6210: Database Management and Database Design  
**Institution:** Northeastern University  

## Overview
The Smart Home Management System was developed as a comprehensive database solution to manage and automate various functionalities of a smart home. The project utilized advanced SQL techniques to design and implement an integrated database capable of handling user interactions, device management, scheduling, and security features. The system aimed to provide users with seamless control over their home environment while ensuring data security and operational efficiency.

## Key Features
1. **Database Creation and Schema Design:**
   - Created normalized database tables with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure data integrity.
   - Designed entities like users, devices, rooms, and schedules, reflecting a real-world smart home scenario.

2. **Device Management:**
   - Supported registration and monitoring of smart devices such as lights, thermostats, and security cameras.
   - Included encryption for sensitive device data to maintain confidentiality.

3. **Scheduling Automation:**
   - Implemented stored procedures for automating routines (e.g., turning devices on/off based on schedules).
   - Enabled real-time updates to schedules and device status via triggers.

4. **Data Security and Encryption:**
   - Utilized encryption mechanisms such as symmetric keys and certificates for sensitive data.
   - Developed stored procedures for encryption and decryption, ensuring secure data handling.

5. **User-defined Functions:**
   - Functions to calculate energy consumption by devices and generate usage reports.
   - Features to evaluate and optimize scheduling for energy efficiency.

6. **Dashboard Views and Analytics:**
   - Created views for real-time insights into system performance, energy consumption, and device status.
   - Analytical features to evaluate system usage trends.

7. **Triggers for Real-time Operations:**
   - Automated updates to schedules and notifications for specific user or system-triggered events.

8. **Indexes for Performance Optimization:**
   - Indexed key columns to enhance the efficiency of query operations, particularly for device and schedule lookups.

## Technical Stack
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server  
- **Tools & Techniques:** T-SQL, stored procedures, views, user-defined functions, triggers, and encryption.  
- **Key Concepts:** Database normalization, data encryption, indexing, and real-time data handling.  

## Outcome
This project provided hands-on experience with database design and management principles, emphasizing secure and efficient data handling. It showcased a practical application of database systems in real-world scenarios, demonstrating the ability to design robust, scalable, and secure solutions for smart home environments.
